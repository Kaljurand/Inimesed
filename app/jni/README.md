Swig
----

Both `edu` and `pocketsphinx_wrap.c` are automatically generated by swig,
i.e. they should not be tracked by this repository. The problem is
that starting with swig 2.0.5 its generated files did not compile anymore
with `ndk-build`, so we checked in the v2.0.4 generated files.


Android NDK
-----------

Set an environment variable `ANDROID_NDK` to point to the Android NDK,
e.g. in case of Bash:

	export ANDROID_NDK=${HOME}/myapps/android-ndk-r8e/
