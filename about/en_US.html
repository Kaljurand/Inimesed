<div class="intro">
<b>Inimesed</b> is a simple app that lets you search and pick a contact
from your address book.
<b>Inimesed</b> is not a general purpose contact manager that could 
replace the device's existing contact manager, e.g. one cannot edit the
contacts list using <b>Inimesed</b>.
The focus of <b>Inimesed</b> is solely on search,
making the contact picking action as fast and hands-free as possible. To
that end the app employs <b>search-by-voice</b>.
</div>

<h2>Usage</h2>

<p><b>Inimesed</b> can be launched by tapping its launcher icon. Once launched
the list of names in your address book is shown together with information
on when and how much they have been contacted, etc. This list is sortable by
various parameters.</p>

<p>You can select a name in two
ways, either by scrolling to it and then tapping on it, or (often faster)
by holding your finger on the microphone button and uttering a voice command.
Once the name is selected an action is performed. The actions are</p>

<dl>
<dt>CALL</dt>
<dd>dial the default number and hit the call button</dd>

<dt>DIAL</dt>
<dd>just dial the default number</dd>

<dt>VIEW</dt>
<dd>launch the contact viewer (which lets you then choose a number to call,
send an SMS, etc.)</dd>
</dl>

<p>If the name was selected by tapping, then the action depends on the
corresponding setting which can be set via the <i>Settings</i>-menu.
In case of a voice command the action depends on the command (see below).</p>

<p><b>Inimesed</b> can be also launched from another app, if it calls a
contact picker and <b>Inimesed</b> is proposed as one of the apps
that can perform contact picking. In this case, in however way the contact
is selected, its information is returned to the calling app which processes
it further.</p>

<h2>Voice commands</h2>

<p>Searching the contact list by voice is simple: hold down the big yellow
button and speak the name of the person whom you want to contact.</p>

<p>The grammar of the commands is formally governed by the following BNF
rules.</p>

<pre>
command := <i>NAME</i>
command := (helista | vali) palun <i>NAME</i>
</pre>

<p>where <i>NAME</i> is the name of the contact as it appears in the
contacts list. The current version of <b>Inimesed</b> only searches names
that are written using the letters of the Estonian alphabet, e.g. if the
name of the contact is written in a Greek or Thai script it will not be
found.</p>

<p>Some examples of legal utterances.</p>

<pre>
helista palun Jaan Jaanson
vali palun Jaan Jaanson
Jaan Jaanson
</pre>


<h2>Settings</h2>

<p>Note that some settings require the app to be restarted, i.e. press
BACK as long as you reach the home screen and then relaunch the app.</p>

<dl>
<dt>Confirm name by speech</dt>
<dd>Synthesized voice will repeat the voice
command. It tries to speak with an Estonian accent, if this fails then
with Spanish, if this fails then with German, if this fails then with
American English, and if this also fails then it will not say anything.</dd>

<dt>People with phone</dt>
<dd>Display and search only those contacts that have a phone number.</dd>

<dt>Action when contact tapped</dt>
<dd>Lets you specify the action that is performed when the contact
is selected by tapping on the corresponding contact list item.</dd>

<dt>Confidence level</dt>
<dd>Confidence level that is required to perform the action. In noisy
environments the recognizer often makes mistakes but also has lower
confidence (e.g. &lt;-3). Setting the confidence level lower makes
sure that commands are not carried out if the recognizer is unsure whether
it understood them correctly.</dd>
</dl>

<h2>Permissions</h2>

<p>The app requires the following permissions to run.</p>

<dl>
<dt>WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE</dt>
<dd>The app stores the acoustic models and grammars on the device's
external storage, into the directory
<code>Android/data/ee.ioc.phon.android.inimesed</code>. This
directory does not store any permanent data, it just has to exist while
the app is running. You can thus delete it anytime, it will be recreated
the next time the app runs.</dd>

<dt>RECORD_AUDIO</dt>
<dd>The app needs access to the microphone
to record the audio to be transcribed. The audio recording is on only
while the finger touches the microphone button.</dd>

<dt>READ_CONTACTS</dt>
<dd>In order to display the list of contacts and to generate a speech
recognition grammar based on
the names of the contacts the app needs to access the address book.</dd>

<dt>CALL_PHONE</dt>
<dd>The app can directly call a phone number. It only does this when you
issue the respective command.</dd>
</dl>

<p>Because the app cannot use the internet, your private address book
can never leave the device. Note however that the grammar file which contains
the names of your contacts (just the names, not phone numbers nor
any other info)
is stored on external storage while the app is running,
so it is technically accessible to all other apps on the phone.</p>

<h2>Tips</h2>

<p>The current version of <b>Inimesed</b> uses Estonian acoustic models and
an Estonian pronunciation dictionary. So try to pronounce the names in your
best Estonian accent. For example, if you want to find a James, pronounce his
name as <code>/J A M E S/</code> not <code>/JH EY M Z/</code>. Note also that
the spoken feedback is not an indication of correct pronunciation, as the
feedback language most likely differs from Estonian (i.e. Estonian
speech synthesis is not yet available on Android).</p>


<h2>Resources</h2>

<p>The built-in speech recognizer is based on PocketSphinx by the
<a href="http://cmusphinx.sourceforge.net/">CMU Sphinx project</a>.
Note that since the recognizer is built-in, the app can be used
without an internet connection and its performance depends only
on the performance of the device. On slower devices (single core
with less than 1GHz), the app might be too slow to be usable.</p>

<p>The Estonian acoustic models have been created by the
<a href="http://www.phon.ioc.ee/">Laboratory of Phonetics and Speech
Technology, Institute of Cybernetics at Tallinn University of
Technology</a> and are available at
<a href="https://github.com/alumae/et-pocketsphinx-tutorial">github.com/alumae/et-pocketsphinx-tutorial</a>. Note that the models that are pre-installed
with the app have been optimized for short loading and recognition
time rather than high quality recognition. On Samsung Galaxy S2
the app starts up in a couple of seconds and the transcription is
delivered almost instantly.</p>

<!-- If you experience low quality transcription
but have a fast device (e.g. Galaxy S3) then you can consider installing
slower but higher quality models.
